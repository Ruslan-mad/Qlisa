//! Preflight validation — detect cues whose external dependencies do not resolve
//! (missing media file, dangling Stop/Fade target, unpatched fixture, absent MIDI
//! port, …) so the operator sees them *before* the show rather than at GO time.
//!
//! Each cue type reports its own problems via [`Cue::validate`](super::traits::Cue::validate),
//! keeping cue-specific knowledge in the cue (a new cue type validates itself and
//! needs no change to the walker).  Media-file existence is checked centrally by
//! the command layer via [`Cue::media_file_path`](super::traits::Cue::media_file_path).
