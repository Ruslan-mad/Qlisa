//! Undo / redo history for the cue list.
//!
//! Uses a snapshot-based approach: before each mutating operation the entire
//! active cue list is captured as a [`Snapshot`].  Each cue is serialised to
//! JSON plus its decoded audio `Arc` is cloned (cheap — it is a reference-counted
//! pointer, not a copy of the raw samples).  Restoration rebuilds cues via the
//! `CueRegistry` and injects the saved audio Arc back, so there is never a
//! re-decode round-trip on undo/redo.
