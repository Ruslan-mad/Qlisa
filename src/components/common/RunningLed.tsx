/**
 * Running-cue indicator that blinks via a discrete JS interval (~1.4 Hz) instead
 * of a continuous CSS keyframe animation.
 *
 * A CSS keyframe animation forces WebKitGTK to commit a fresh frame for the entire
 * UI surface every display refresh (~60 fps) for the whole lifetime of the
 * animation.  On a weak shared-memory iGPU that monopolises the compositor and
 * starves the UI's own paint while a Video Cue's output window is also presenting —
 * the Inkue UI froze to ~0 fps during video playback.  A discrete opacity toggle
 * repaints only a few times per second and leaves the UI surface idle in between,
 * so the compositor has room for both the UI and the video output.
